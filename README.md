# NoteApp_Python

# 📝 Notebook App

A simple note-taking desktop application built with Python and Tkinter. This app lets you create, rename, delete, and save multiple notes — all organized neatly in tabs.

## 💡 Features

- 🗂 **Tabbed Interface** — Work on multiple notes at once using tabbed navigation.
- ➕ **Create Notes** — Add new notes with a single click.
- ✏️ **Rename Tabs** — Easily rename notes via right-click or the "Rename" button.
- 🗑 **Delete Notes** — Remove unwanted notes (at least one tab must remain).
- 💾 **Save Notes** — Save all your notes to a local JSON file.
- 🔁 **Auto-Load on Startup** — Previously saved notes are automatically restored when you reopen the app.

## 📂 Note Storage

All notes are saved locally in a file called `notes_storage.json`, which is created in the same directory as the app.

> **Note:** The app depends on `notes_storage.json` to fully function. If it doesn’t exist, it will be created automatically when you save your first note.
